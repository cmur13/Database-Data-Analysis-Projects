## ðŸ“˜ Projects Overview

### ðŸ“„ Pandas I (elections.csv)

**Description:**  
Using the `elections.csv` dataset, this assignment walks through foundational Pandas operations which include reading CSV files, inspecting data types and shapes, and filtering and slicing rows/columns

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

### ðŸ“„ Pandas II (elections.csv + SSA Baby Names Dataset)
**Description:**  
This assignment walks through more advanced functions in pandas using two datasets: elections.csv and the SSA baby_names dataset. The tasks focus on manipulating and cleaning real-world datasets. It emphasizes: 
- Data extraction using loc, iloc, and bracket notation ([])
- Conditional selection of rows
- Adding, removing, and modifying columns
- Useful utility function
- Custom sorts

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

### ðŸ“„ Pandas III (elections.csv)
**Description:**  
This assignment delves into advanced pandas functionalities using the elections.csv and SSA baby names datasets. It emphasizes:
- GroupBy Operations: Aggregating data based on specific criteria to derive meaningful insights.
- Pivot Tables: Reshaping data for better analysis and visualization.
- Joining Tables: Combining multiple datasets to enrich the analysis.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


### ðŸ“Š Matplotlib / Seaborn Visualization
**Description:**  
This open-ended assignment focuses on building custom visualizations to explore and communicate insights from two datasets: `elections.csv` and the SSA `baby_names` dataset. Students were asked to create three visualizations for each dataset using either `Matplotlib` or `Seaborn`.

**Tools Used:**
- Python (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

### ðŸ“ˆ Tableau Visualization
**Description:**  
This open-ended assignment requires creating six different plots using Tableau to explore and visualize a chosen dataset(netflix.csv). The goal is to use Tableauâ€™s features to uncover insights and present data effectively.

**Tools Used:**  
- Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public

### K-Means & Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering

**Description:**  
This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering techniques using Python. The goal is to understand how these clustering methods group data points based on similarity.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (with libraries such as pandas and matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook

### HuggingFace Pipelines

**Description:**  
In this project, I used HuggingFaceâ€™s Transformers pipelines to perform various NLP tasks. For each pipeline, two example uses are provided to demonstrate capabilities such as feature extraction, masked word prediction, named entity recognition, question answering, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, translation, and zero-shot classification.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- HuggingFace Transformers library  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“˜ Projects Overview

### ðŸ“„ Pandas I (elections.csv)

**Description:**  
Using the `elections.csv` dataset, this assignment walks through foundational Pandas operations which include reading CSV files, inspecting data types and shapes, and filtering and slicing rows/columns

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

### ðŸ“„ Pandas II (elections.csv + SSA Baby Names Dataset)
**Description:**  
This assignment walks through more advanced functions in pandas using two datasets: elections.csv and the SSA baby_names dataset. The tasks focus on manipulating and cleaning real-world datasets. It emphasizes: 
- Data extraction using loc, iloc, and bracket notation ([])
- Conditional selection of rows
- Adding, removing, and modifying columns
- Useful utility function
- Custom sorts

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

### ðŸ“„ Pandas III (elections.csv)
**Description:**  
This assignment delves into advanced pandas functionalities using the elections.csv and SSA baby names datasets. It emphasizes:
- GroupBy Operations: Aggregating data based on specific criteria to derive meaningful insights.
- Pivot Tables: Reshaping data for better analysis and visualization.
- Joining Tables: Combining multiple datasets to enrich the analysis.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


### ðŸ“Š Matplotlib / Seaborn Visualization
**Description:**  
This open-ended assignment focuses on building custom visualizations to explore and communicate insights from two datasets: `elections.csv` and the SSA `baby_names` dataset. Students were asked to create three visualizations for each dataset using either `Matplotlib` or `Seaborn`.

**Tools Used:**
- Python (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

# Database Systems Labs

This repository contains lab work and exercises completed as part of my university-level **Database Systems** course. The labs focused on practical SQL skills, relational database design, and implementation of database features using **MySQL**.

## üîç What I Learned

- **SQL Querying**
  - Constructing complex queries using `JOIN`s, subqueries, `GROUP BY`, aggregate functions, and window functions.
  - Filtering and transforming data for analysis and reporting.

- **Stored Procedures & Triggers**
  - Creating stored procedures to encapsulate logic and reuse query patterns.
  - Implementing triggers to automate tasks and enforce business rules at the database level.

- **Schema Design & Normalization**
  - Designing relational database schemas using Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling.
  - Applying normalization principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to improve efficiency and eliminate redundancy.

- **Hands-On MySQL**
  - Writing and testing SQL code in a real MySQL environment.
  - Using MySQL Workbench and command-line tools to manage and interact with databases.
